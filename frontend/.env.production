# Since frontend is served by the same Go backend on port 8080,
# we use the browser's current location to construct the URLs.
# This works for any domain/IP where the app is deployed.

# For HTTP API: Use empty string to make it relative to current origin
# The api.ts will use window.location.origin if empty
VITE_API_BASE_URL=

# For WebSocket: Use empty string and we'll construct ws:// or wss:// based on current protocol
