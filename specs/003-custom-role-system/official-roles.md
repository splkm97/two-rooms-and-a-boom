## Special Characters

### Ambassador
**Type:** Condition
**Player Count:** 11 or more players recommended

**Special Rules:**
As soon as you are dealt your card, announce "I am an Ambassador!" Your card is permanently publicly revealed. You have the "immune" condition. Players with the "immune" condition are immune to all powers and conditions. Ambassadors can walk freely between the 2 rooms. Ambassadors are never considered a part of a room's population. Therefore, Ambassadors can never take part in any vote, be hostages, be leaders, and they can never be targeted by abilities.

**Note:** Ambassadors don't count towards the player count in the game. This means if you have 18 players including the Ambassadors, you should be playing a 16 player game. Ambassadors don't count for or against Team Zombie's win objective.

**Pros:**
- 11 or more players recommended

**Cons:**
- Do not bury Ambassadors
- There must be 2 Ambassadors for proper game balance

---

### Tuesday Knight
**Type:** Card Share Power
**Recommended Pair:** Dr. Boom

**Power - HUG:**
If you card share with the Bomber, everyone in the same room as you, except the President, gains the "dead" condition and the game instantly ends.

**Note:** The HUG power never works on the Martyr. If the Bomber is buried, the HUG power is never used.

**Pros:**
- Characters with card share powers recommended

**Cons:**
- Games can last less than 30 seconds
- Without Dr. Boom, Blue Team has the advantage
- Doesn't work well with characters that pause the game (e.g. Sniper, Private Eye, etc.)
