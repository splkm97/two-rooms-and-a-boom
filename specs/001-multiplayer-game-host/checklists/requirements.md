# Specification Quality Checklist: 멀티플레이어 게임 진행 시스템

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-22
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ PASSED - All quality checks completed successfully

### Content Quality Assessment
- Specification focuses entirely on user needs and game mechanics
- No technical implementation details (Go, React, WebSocket, etc.) mentioned
- Written in clear, non-technical Korean language
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

### Requirement Completeness Assessment
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present
- All 20 functional requirements are specific, testable, and unambiguous
- Success criteria use measurable metrics (time, count, percentage)
- Success criteria are technology-agnostic (e.g., "3초 이내" instead of "API response time")
- 5 user stories with comprehensive acceptance scenarios
- 7 edge cases identified and documented
- Clear scope boundaries with "Out of Scope" section
- Assumptions section provides context for design decisions

### Feature Readiness Assessment
- Each user story (P1-P5) can be independently tested and delivered
- Acceptance scenarios use Given-When-Then format for clarity
- Functional requirements directly support user stories
- Success criteria align with user value (e.g., SC-009: 90% users can complete tasks without help)

## Notes

- Specification is ready for planning phase (`/speckit.plan`)
- All quality criteria met without requiring clarifications
- Feature scope is well-defined with clear MVP path (P1 → P2 → P3 → P4 → P5)
